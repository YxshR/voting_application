# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a real-time voting application that allows multiple users to log in from different browsers, cast votes on predefined options, and view live results. The system emphasizes simplicity with a streamlined login process and real-time updates using WebSockets for an engaging user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a voter, I want to log in with just my name, so that I can quickly access the voting system without complex authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a login page with a name input field
2. WHEN a user enters a name and submits THEN the system SHALL create a session for that user
3. WHEN a user submits an empty name THEN the system SHALL display an error message requiring a valid name
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the voting page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a voter, I want to see voting options and cast my vote, so that I can participate in the poll.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in user accesses the voting page THEN the system SHALL display 2-3 voting options (Option A, Option B, Option C)
2. WHEN a user selects an option and submits their vote THEN the system SHALL record the vote in the database
3. WHEN a user tries to vote multiple times in the same session THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate votes and display an appropriate message
4. WHEN a user successfully votes THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the results page

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a voter, I want to see live voting results, so that I can understand the current state of the poll.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the results page THEN the system SHALL display the current vote tally for each option
2. WHEN any user casts a vote THEN the system SHALL update the results in real-time for all connected users via WebSockets
3. WHEN a user refreshes the results page THEN the system SHALL display the most current vote counts
4. WHEN the results page loads THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection for real-time updates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a voter, I want to see results displayed visually, so that I can easily understand the voting distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the results page displays vote counts THEN the system SHALL show results as both numbers and visual charts (bar chart or pie chart)
2. WHEN vote counts change THEN the system SHALL update the visual representation in real-time
3. WHEN there are no votes yet THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message indicating no votes have been cast

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure data integrity and prevent voting fraud, so that the poll results are accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user session is created THEN the system SHALL track the session to prevent duplicate voting
2. WHEN a user attempts to vote after already voting in their session THEN the system SHALL reject the vote and display an error message
3. WHEN the system detects potential duplicate voting attempts THEN the system SHALL log the attempt for monitoring purposes
4. WHEN a user closes their browser and returns THEN the system SHALL maintain their voting status if the session is still valid

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a voter, I want the application to work seamlessly across different browsers, so that multiple users can participate simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users access the application from different browsers THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent sessions independently
2. WHEN users vote simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process all votes correctly without conflicts
3. WHEN the WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
4. WHEN real-time updates fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to auto-refresh every 5 seconds as a backup mechanism
